# In this example, we will set up SSH password-less automatic login from server 192.168.0.12 as user bharat-15 to 192.168.0.11 with user bharat-ml.
# To configre passwordless SSH for remote connection, follow below commands.

step-1: Install openssh-server on all machine.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server

step-2: To check whether SSH is up and running or not
sudo systemctl status ssh

step-3: Now Create Authentication SSH-Keygen Keys on â€“ (192.168.0.12).
# first check whether ssh keys are present or not
ls -al ~/.ssh/id_*.pub
# If keys not present, then follow below steps-
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@domain.com"

or you can try this comamnd as well. and then copy from /home/.ssh folder content of id_ed25519.pub.

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "bharatbhushansingh2019@gmail.com"


# now check below directories, whether keys got generated or not.
ls ~/.ssh/id_*

step-3: Now upload ssh keys to remote (192.168.0.11) as user bharat-ml.
ssh-copy-id bharat-ml@192.168.0.11

step-4: test this passwordless ssh setup from 192.168.0.12

# From now onwards you can log into 192.168.0.11 as bharat-ml user from server 192.168.0.12 as a bharat-15 user without a password.
ssh bharat-ml@192.168.0.11
