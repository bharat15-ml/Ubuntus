# You can create new user in ubuntu using two commands - useradd, adduser. Also you should have root permission for that.
1. create new user using - adduser
sudo adduser bharat
# then enter all required details, whichever was asked on command prompt.

2. to give root or sudo permission to newly added user
sudo usermod -aG sudo bharat

3. to delete user
sudo deluser bharat
sudo deluser --remove-home bharat

# To verify, whether new user created or not
cat /etc/passwd | grep '^bharat'


# You can also create new user with low level utility - useradd
1. sudo useradd -s /path/to/shell -d /home/{dirname} -m -G {secondary-group} {username}
example - sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/bharat/ -m -G sudo bharat

2. sudo passwd {username}
example - sudo passwd bharat

here- 
-s /bin/bash – Set /bin/bash as login shell of the new account
-d /home/vivek/ – Set /home/bharat/ as home directory of the new Ubuntu account
-m – Create the user’s home directory
-G sudo – Make sure bharat user can sudo i.e. give admin access to the new account
